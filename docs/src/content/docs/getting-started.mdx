Sonny is a chatbot built with Python, TwitchIO, hosted on Heroku, and named and inspired by the Sonny character from the "[I, Robot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)>)" movie of 2004, and used on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/Superp0sit1on).

## Quick Start

### Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/Superp0sit1on/sonny.git
```

### Install the dependencies

On the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
pipenv install
```

### Setup the environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your chatbot credentials and definitions. Example:

```env title=".env"
TOKEN=oauth:****
NICKNAME=chatbot_username # Your Twitch channel if it doesn't have a separate chatbot account
CHANNELS=your_channel
BOTS=example_bot, another_example_bot
```

:::note
You can get your chatbot token from the [Twitch Apps TMI](https://twitchapps.com/tmi) website.
:::

### Run the local environment

On the terminal, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
pipenv run bot
```

:::caution
Don't forget to grant mod privileges with `/mod nameofyourbot` to your chatbot on your Twitch channel if it runs under a different account.
