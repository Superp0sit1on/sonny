Here you can find a quickstart guide on how to write your own commands for your Twitch bot.

## Writing a command

To write your own commands on the `src/commands.py` file, you can follow the `!ping` command example below:

```python title="src/commands.py" {8-11}
from twitchio.ext import commands


class BotCommands(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    # Command to respond to the !ping message
    @commands.command(name="ping")
    async def cmd_ping(self, ctx: commands.Context):
        await ctx.send(f"pong! üèì") # Reply on the chat with a pong


def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(BotCommands(bot))
```
